## Pre-requisites

1. You can access the google cloud docker registry
1. Ask to become a team member of sdcplatform
1. Run `gcloud auth configure-docker europe-west2-docker.pkg.dev` to associate your docker with the GCR registry
1. Run `docker network create ssdcrmdockerdev_default` to create the docker network
1. Connect to the gcr registry and perform a `make pull` do bring down docker-compose images

Important is to configure your python environment - that's covered next.

### Docker Resources

The services need at least 5 CPUs and 7GB RAM between them for their resource allocations, so you will need to open the
Docker settings and increase its resource allowances to at least these amounts. If you will be running anything else
alongside the ATs (e.g. Another services integration tests) you may want to allow another CPU and GB of RAM for
headroom.

## Quickstart

![make up](https://media.giphy.com/media/xULW8lyhMJjzyO33sA/giphy.gif)

```shell
make up
```

Will spin up all the dependencies and services.

### Updating Images

To force pull the latest images use

```shell
make pull
```

## Configure Local Python Environments to Run Acceptance Tests

### Currently Supported Python Version is 3.11.x

The goal is to setup our python environments ready to run Python 3.X.X (whaterver is currently supported). It is good
practise to keep your machine version in line with the latest.

Validate your python versions with **`python -V`** and printenv.

Initializing pyenv is one of those boring things that must always be done. You can circumnavigate this by adding the
below command to the .zshrc (if using a z shell) or .inputrc or .profile or .bash_profile (if using a bash on a Mac).

```shell
eval "$(pyenv init -)"
```

- **`pyenv --version`** # check whether pyenv is installed
- **`brew install pyenv`** # install pyenv with brew
- **`pyenv install 3.X.Y`** # the app needs python 3.9
- **`pyenv local 3.x.y`** # whenever you come to this directory this python will be used

pyenv local will create a **.python-version** file so that whenever you return to the directory your python env is set.
Note that this has been put into `.gitignore`

## PipEnv | Upgrading Python | Projects with a Pip File

As this project maintains a pip file you can ascertain validity by running **`pipenv check`** - whenever Python is
upgraded the Pipfile change is all that is required. To ensure you are in sync use

- **`pipenv check`** # check whether the environments match
- **`pipenv --rm`** # if the check fails remove the current environment

## Setup Based on python 3.X.Y

Use [Pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) to manage installed Python versions

[Pipenv](https://docs.pipenv.org/) is required locally for running setup scripts

```bash
pip install -U pipenv
```

## Slowstart

There are two docker-compose files:

- rm-dependencies.yml - spins up the backing service containers such as postgres and pubsub emulator
- rm-services.yml - spins up the RM and RH services such as case-processor and rh-ui

These can be run together as per the Quickstart section or individually.

```shell
docker compose -f rm-dependencies.yml -f rm-services.yml up -d
```

This will spin up the development containers and the rm-services.

Additionally, individual services can be specified at the end of the command. For example:

```shell
docker compose -f rm-services.yml up -d caseprocessor
```

This will spin up just the Case Processor container, however be aware that individual services may not function
correctly or even start up at all without their dependencies and integrations.

If you're spinning things up manually, you will also need to manually run the `setup_pubsub.sh` script to create the
required topics and subscriptions in the PubSub Emulator.

## Development

### Running in docker with local changes

Development using this repo can be done by doing the following:

1. Move to the repository directory and make the code changes in the service repository locally
1. Rebuild the image to overwrite your local `latest` image with your changes, for example using `make build-no-test`,
   but check the README in the repository for specific build commands.
1. Finally, return to the docker-dev repository and restart the service with `make up`. You should see the image you
   have rebuilt get recreated.

### Running natively with local changes

1. Ensure you have all your services running with `make up`
1. Stop the service you're changing with `docker stop <service>`, e.g. `docker stop caseprocessor`
1. Make changes to whichever repository.
1. Depending on the repository, run it from either the command line using the appropriate command (e.g. for a python
   flask app: `flask run`) or by pressing run in your IDE.

### pgAdmin 4

1. Start all the services `make up`
2. Navigate to `localhost:81` in your browser
3. Login with `ons@ons.gov` / `secret`
4. Object -> Register -> Server...
5. Give it a suitable name in the `General` tab
6. Then in the `Connection` tab set:

   | <!-- -->              | <!-- -->    |
   | --------------------- |-------------|
   | Host name/ address:   | `postgres`  |
   | Port:                 | `5432`      |
   | Maintenance database: | `postgres`  |
   | Username:             | `appuser`   |
   | Password:             | `postgres`  |

7. Click save to close the dialog and connect to the postgres docker container

## Troubleshooting

### Not logged in

```shell
Pulling iac (sdcplatform/iacsvc:latest)...
ERROR: pull access denied for sdcplatform/iacsvc, repository does not exist or may require 'docker login'
make: *** [pull] Error 1
```

1. Create a docker hub account
1. Run `docker login` in a terminal and use your docker hub account

If this still doesn't work run `gcloud auth configure-docker europe-west2-docker.pkg.dev`\
to associate your docker with the GCR registry.

### Database already running

- `postgres` container not working? Check there isn't a local postgres running on your system as it uses port 5432
  and won't start if another service is running on this port.

### Port already bound to

```text
ERROR: for collection-instrument  Cannot start service collection-instrument-service: driver failed programming external connectivity on endpoint collection-instrument (7c6ad787c9d57028a44848719d8d705b14e1f82ea2f393ada80e5f7e476c50b1): Error starting userland pStarting secure-message ... done

ERROR: for collection-instrument-service  Cannot start service collection-instrument-service: driver failed programming external connectivity on endpoint collection-instrument (7c6ad787c9d57028a44848719d8d705b14e1f82ea2f393ada80e5f7e476c50b1): Error starting userland proxy: Bind for 0.0.0.0:8002 failed: port is already allocated
ERROR: Encountered errors while bringing up the project.
make: *** [up] Error 1
```

- Kill the process hogging that port by running `lsof -n -i:8002|awk 'FNR == 2 { print $2 }'|xargs kill` where 8002 is
  the port you are trying to bind to

### Docker network

```text
ERROR: Network ssdcrmdockerdev_default declared as external, but could not be found. Please create the network manually using `docker network create ssdcrmdockerdev_default` and try again.
make: *** [up] Error 1
```

- Run `docker network create ssdcrmdockerdev_default` to create the docker network.

**NB:** Docker compose may warn you that the network is unused. This is a lie, it is in use.

### Java Healthcheck

Since docker compose health checks are run inside the container, we need a method of checking service health that can
run in our minimal alpine Java JRE images. To accomplish this, we have a small Java health check class which simply
calls a http endpoint and succeeds if it gets a success status. This is compiled into a JAR, which is then mounted into
the containers, so it can be executed by the JRE at container runtime.

#### Making Changes

If you make changes to the [HealthCheck.java](java_healthcheck/HealthCheck.java), you must then
run `make rebuild-java-healthcheck` to compile and package the updated class into the jar.

### Unexpected behavior

1. Stop docker containers `make down`
1. Remove containers `docker rm $(docker ps -aq)`
1. Delete images `docker rmi $(docker images europe-west2-docker.pkg.dev/ssdc-rm-ci/docker/* -qa)`
1. Pull and run containers `make up`

### Service not up?

Some services aren't resilient to the database not being up before the service has started. Rerun `make up`

### Services running sluggishly?

When rm is all running it takes a lot of memory. Click on the docker icon in the top bar of your Mac, then click on '
preferences', then go to the 'advanced' tab. The default memory allocated to Docker is 2gb. Bumping that up to 8gb and
the number of cores to 5 should make the service run much smoother. Note: These aren't hard and fast numbers, this is
just what worked for people.

### Containers not updating or failing to write to disk?

#### Or Docker using too much disk space in general?

Over time, images and volumes can accumulate and consume too much disk storage space. If this reaches Docker's storage
limit then it will cause failures when running our services, as containers will be denied disk writes, as well as
failing image pulls.
Most of this space is normally consumed by "dangling" or unused images and volumes, these can be automatically cleaned
up with the `prune` tool.

To automatically clean up containers, images, and volumes try running

```shell
docker system prune --volumes
```

## Pubsub Tools

Some tooling scripts are provided for easy interaction with the pubsub emulator

### Prerequisites

Install and/or update dependencies with

```shell
make install
```

### Publishing to Pub/Sub Topics in Emulator

Run `./publish_message.sh <TOPIC> <PROJECT>` and then paste in a JSON message. Press CTRL-D when you're done.

### Pulling from Pub/Sub Subscriptions in Emulator

Run `./get_message.sh <SUBSCRIPTION> <PROJECT>`.

### Purging Messages on a Pub/Sub Subscriptions in Emulator

Run `./clear_messages.sh <SUBSCRIPTION> <PROJECT>`.

## Checking out, building multiple branches from a PR

Run `SKIP_TESTS=<true/false> BRANCH_NAME=<branch name> ./checkout_and_build_pr.sh`

This will checkout and build a PR Branch for you. This script does not checkout docker-dev (what happens if the PR
includes an update to the script!)
Instead if the PR contains a docker-dev PR, checkout that docker dev. Run ./checkout_and_build_pr.sh and it'll look at
the branch you're on and checkout and install in ./PR_DIR/ under docker dev. It should bring up the new images and
unless SKIP_TESTS=true it will run the ATs too.

If the PR doesn't have a docker dev, then run the script from main and specify the BRANCH_NAME.
